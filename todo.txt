TODO:
VFX in general
Add projectile image(s) for consume
weapon images

Mold:
handle immovable pawns

Swap:
test frozen tiles
Maybe just don't allow alot of things - swapping objectives, non pushables, custom tiles, etc. Probably easiest
Don't allow items - treat like pods
handle and belts, teleporters?
consolidate terrain & damage

Consume:
Emerging vek space
sand tiles not working

Acheivements:
Utilitarian - how to get queued attacks?
images

Candidates:
Visual "bug" showing push damage when swap pushed with adjacent mountain or building. Not sure there is a way around this
